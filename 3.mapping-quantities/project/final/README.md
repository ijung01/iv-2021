## Project 3: Mapping Quantities, Categories, and Summarized Data

For this graphic development, I've tried to investigate if there is a noticeable relationship between the number of tests conducted by countries and their diplomatic activeness. The proximity of the countries (distance between the center point and their starting points) depend on the number of international summits/conferences each country had participated. The width of the lines represent the number of tests conducted.
