TItle: Year In A Room

Today we are welcoming you to a virtual space visualizing three clock variables and date variables.
It's time to spend a whole year in a room! Have you ever wondered what it would look like over the course of a year?
This hybrid clock shows how it changes every season, month, week, day, hour, minute, and seconds. 

Clock Variables: now.progress.day, now.progress.hour, now.progress.min 


1) Hours
—CIRCLE TIME INDICATOR (now.progress.day -> position -> bottom to top) 
—HOUR LINE (size -> length of line -> difference in time measurements -> shortest = largest time measurement -> hours)

2) Minutes
—CIRCLE TIME INDICATOR (now.progress.hour -> position -> left to right)
—MINUTE LINE (size -> length of line -> difference in time measurements -> middle = second largest time measurement -> minutes)

3) Seconds
—CIRCLE TIME INDICATOR (now.progress.min -> position -> right to left)
—SECOND LINE (size -> length of line -> difference in time measurements -> longest = smallest time measurement -> seconds)

Date Variables: now.progress.year, now.progress.week, now.progress.day 

1) Month & Season
-BACKGROUND COLOR (now.progress.year -> color -> gradient of 4 different colors to show progression of year)
-TOP POINT OF LIGHT TRIANGLE (now.progress.year -> position -> JAN to DEC -> left to right)

2) Day of Week
-BOTTOM LEFT POINT OF LIGHT TRIANGLE (now.progress.week -> a. position / b. size -> right to left / area of the light is in proportion to the day of the week)

3) Progression of Day 
-FILL OF LIGHT TRIANGLE (now.progress.day -> value -> hour 0 to 23 -> 0 to 100 opacity change)
