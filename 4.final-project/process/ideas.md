#### Potential project topics & questions

What are some observations you find noteworthy?
What insights could this offer?
How is it related to visualization, what can visualization reveal here?
What new ideas came out of the process of sketching and research?
What are the next steps?


1. We write (language) to express and communicate. What are some hidden information that we can uncover from writings? Could the results give us more insight into the contnet or is it irrelavant information? If it is irrelavant, how can we highlight information that is hidden in written langauge? 

2. Sound is defined by its presence and absence. From marking the silences in everyday conversations, lectures/talks, scripts, and music, what understandings can we get on how the intentional vs unintentional moments of silence shape meaning? or can we even identiy if they are intentional or unintentional? crucial or supplementary? 

3. We use images to represent us. Words that describes us. Reputations and emotions to define us. But in what ways do we quantify ourselves? How are numbers related to your identity? What are some ways we are represetned, identified, and translated through alphanumeric values? (exploring different ways of personal identifiaction). 

4. We are surrounded by different types of measurements. What are some daily measurements that we can convert into code to visualize it in a different way? Would the results be more effective in portraying the quanitified information than the original format it takes? Going further, can we use different methods of visualization to create a universal measurement? 

5. There are days when you feel like the season has changed. Sometimes that realization is abrupt and sometimes it's gradual. You might look at time difference in sunrise and sunset, development of color of the trees/flowers, difference in the highs and lows (temperature) of the day. Can we draw an understanding whether or not the seasons are changing (or even identify which season it is) from the changes happening in these areas? 

6. One of my classmates in class mentioned "I lost track of time, time isn't real these days" and I thought it was an interesting concept where the actual progression of time, and the time we might feel could be different. I wonder through visualizing the perception of time if we can draw out a deeper personal/general understanding of how we experience time in a course of a day (and what factors may affect it). 

7. Color coded IKEA's online store. When we group the items sold on IKEA's online store by color, what kind of results will we get? Would the items be similar in size/type/usage? or would it be totally random? 

8. COVID 19 and food delivery service. I personally started to use food delivery more often, and was wondering if other's needs grew just like myself. What are some possible economical/social influences manifested in the food delivery business? (is there an increase in demand for certain types of food? does the increase in demand for food delivery push restaurants to behave in a certain way? such as opening and/or closing earlier/later)

9. Personal research on understanding being bilingual. When do I use English vs Korean and what can I understand about myself documenting those usages? Does a certain type of personality/emotion/character manifest itself more through a certain language? 

10. When is the most quiest time of the day in the city (considering it as a whole)? Looking into the multiple factors that create noise in public spaces (public transporation, human acticity, etc).
